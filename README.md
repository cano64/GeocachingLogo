GeocachingLogo
==========

GeocachingLogo is Arduino library to display geocaching logo on 1602 (or similar) display 
using custom defined characters. It's to be used on Arduino based geocaches.

The artwork itself in this library is mine and I release it under GNU GPL, 
however the Geocaching Logo is a registered trademark of Groundspeak, Inc.
